# Tutorial: Shooting game

In this chapter we will build a shooting game together, step by step.  The Python we will use is: conditionals, loops, lists and functions.

## Step 1: Decide what Actors you will need

My game will need these Actors, so I will draw images for all of them and save them as `.png` files in the `images` folder.

| variable name | image file name | description                             |
|---------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| player        | player.png      | A spaceship controlled by the player    |
| background    | background.png  | 600x800 image of stars                  |
| enemies (list)| enemy.png       | An evil alien                           |
| bullets (list)| bullet.png      | A bullet fired by the player upwards    |
| bombs (list)  | bomb.png        | A bomb dropped by the enemies downwards |

## Step 3: Move your Actors

Run the program.  Why doesn't it work?



## Step 4: Define your functions
