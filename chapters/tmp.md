Sometimes you won't know at the start of the loop how many times you need to iterate.
One solution to this is loop forever with while True. your users probably won't want your prpgram to run forefer however, so you should insert a break statement to end the loop when some condition is met.

booleans are same as if(b==True)

The `and`, `or` and `not` operators operate on booleans and return new boolean values.
