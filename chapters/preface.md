# For the instructor

This book contains all the example programs used in my CoderDojo class to teach Python programming.  The primary goal of the class is to teach
programming using action games to make learning more interesting.  Some of the examples are entirely focused on
introducing new language concepts or showing how the Pygame Zero API works, but most are a mixture of both.

The intention is that
each program is *brief, complete* and *introduces only one or two new concepts*.

* The programs are short so that students can feasibly type them in during the class.  Typing for themselves is very valuable for beginners, because it helps them learn to type, and to type precisely without mistakes (which show up as syntax errors). Even if it takes them a while, they should feel proud when they type a program correctly in the end![^example_footnote]

* Each program is complete to avoid the confusion caused by worksheets that tell a student to add lines to a program piecemeal.  If they make an error or omit a step they may never recover and not produce a working program.  Also being *complete* and *separate* means the whole class can be told to skip to the same program and it won't matter so much that some of them didn't complete all the prior programs.

* Introducing ideas one or two at a time allows the students to learn mostly through *doing* and observing the output of each program rather than memorizing.  To this end the *order* of the programs within each chapter has been carefully selected.  However I have attempted to indicate in the text which programs within each chapter are most important or interesting, and which programs can be skipped.  The chapter ordering is more loose and it is possible to skip back and forth between chapters.  If the text quizzes or the Python fundamentals are boring the students, skip ahead to the graphical games, then come back to the earlier examples when necessary.

Following each program are some ideas for how students can modify the program.  Hopefully they will go further and modify these programs into their own unique games!  The difficulty of these suggestions varies, to accommodate students of different age and ability.

This book may be suitable for self-teaching by a motivated learner, but does not attempt to be comprehensive or give detailed explanations because it is intended to be used in a class with an instructor who will fill in the gaps as needed by the students.

[^example_footnote]: For writing essays nowadays people can use voice input and touch-screen input, but for programming the majority of programmers still type on a keyboard.  There’s no sign of this changing in the immediate future, so practising keyboard skills now is still very important for the future. Students can practise at home with a program such as TuxType. That being said, many programs contain similar code, so it’s also a useful skill for them be able to copy and paste from their other programs.
