# Preface

This book contains all the example programs used in my CoderDojo class to teach Python programming.  The primary goal is to teach
programming with the domain of action games used to make learning more interesting.  Some of the examples are entirely focused on
introducing new language concepts or showing how the Pygame Zero API works, but most are a mixture of both.  The intention is that
each program is short, complete and introduces only one or two new ideas.

Following each program are some ideas for how students can modify the program.  It is hoped they will go further and modify these programs into their own unique games!

I suggest the students type most
of the programs themselves.  I have indicated which ones are more important and more interesting for them to experiment with
and which are more easily skipped.

I think typing for themselves is very valuable to beginners, because it helps them learn to type, and to type precisely without mistakes (which show up as syntax errors). Even if it took them a while, they should feel proud that they typed a correct program in the end![^example_footnote]

This book may be suitable for self-teaching by a motivated learner, but does not attempt to be comprehensive or give detailed explanations
because it is intended to be used in a class with a teacher who can fill in the gaps.

[^example_footnote]: For writing essays nowadays people can use voice input and touch-screen input, but for programming the majority of programmers still type on a keyboard, and there’s no sign of this changing in the immediate future, so practising your keyboard skills now is still very important for the future. (You can do this at home with a program such as TuxType.) That said, many programs contain similar code, so it’s also a useful skill to be able to copy and paste from your other programs!
