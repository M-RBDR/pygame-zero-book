# Preface

This book contains all the example programs used in my CoderDojo class to teach Python programming.  The primary goal is to teach
programming with the domain of action games used to make learning more interesting.  Some of the examples are entirely focused on
introducing new language concepts or showing how the Pygame Zero API works, but most are a mixture of both.

The intention is that
each program is **short, complete and introduces only one or two new ideas**.

* one or two new ideas

    so the student learns mostly through doing and simply observing the output of each program rather than memorizing.  To this end the **order** of the programs within each Lesson has been carefully selected.  However I have attempted to indicate which ones are more important in that sequence / interesting for them to experiment with and which ones are more easily skipped.  The chapter ordering is more loose and it is possible to skip back and forth between chapter.  If the text quizzes or the Python fundamentals are boring the children, skip ahead to the graphical games, then come back to the earlier examples when they are necessary to explain something in the games.

* complete

    to avoid the confusion caused by worksheets that tell a student to add lines to a program piecemeal.  If they make error or ommit a step it seems to often cause them to never recover and never produce a working program.  Also being **complete** and **separate** means the whole class can be told to skip to the same program and it won't matter so much that some of them didnt complete all the prior programs.


* short

    so the student can type most of the programs themselves.  I think typing for themselves is very valuable to beginners, because it helps them learn to type, and to type precisely without mistakes (which show up as syntax errors). Even if it took them a while, they should feel proud that they typed a correct program in the end![^example_footnote]

Following each program are some ideas for how students can modify the program.  It is hoped they will go further and modify these programs into their own unique games!  The difficulty of these suggestions varies, to accommodate students of different age and ability.

This book may be suitable for self-teaching by a motivated learner, but does not attempt to be comprehensive or give detailed explanations because it is intended to be used in a class with a teacher who will fill in the gaps as needed by the students.

[^example_footnote]: For writing essays nowadays people can use voice input and touch-screen input, but for programming the majority of programmers still type on a keyboard, and there’s no sign of this changing in the immediate future, so practising your keyboard skills now is still very important for the future. (You can do this at home with a program such as TuxType.) That said, many programs contain similar code, so it’s also a useful skill to be able to copy and paste from your other programs!
