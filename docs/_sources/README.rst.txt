This book contains all the example programs used in my CoderDojo class
to teach Python programming. The primary goal of the class is to teach
programming using action games to make learning more interesting. Some
of the examples are entirely focused on introducing new language
concepts or showing how the Pygame Zero API works, but most are a
mixture of both.
