This book contains all the example programs used in my CoderDojo class to teach Python programming. The primary goal is to teach programming with the domain of action games used to make learning more interesting. Some of the examples are entirely focused on introducing new language concepts or showing how the Pygame Zero API works, but most are a mixture of both.
